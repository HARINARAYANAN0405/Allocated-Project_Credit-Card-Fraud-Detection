Credit card fraud detection is a critical task in the financial industry to identify and prevent unauthorized transactions.
The goal of a credit card fraud detection system is to distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent transactions, often using machine learning algorithms.
The dataset typically contains various features such as transaction amount, location, time, and other transaction details.

Below is a simple example code for a credit card fraud detection project using Python with popular libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
This code demonstrates basic data exploration and visualization techniques. For a complete fraud detection system, more advanced machine learning models and techniques would be required.

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import warnings

warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')
pd.set_option("display.max_columns", None)

# Load dataset
df = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')

# Display info, first 5 rows, summary statistics, and check for missing values
print("Dataset Info:", df.info())
print("\nFirst 5 Rows:", df.head())
print("\nSummary Statistics:", df.describe())
print("\nMissing Values:", df.isnull().sum())

# Visualize class distribution
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.countplot(x='Class', data=df)
plt.title('Class Distribution')
plt.show()
